# Important
-------------------------
## Notice
>  ```js
> "nodeJs version for Aoi.js ( v5 ) has be changed from v12 to v14."
>  
> "Aoi.js ( v5 ) won't be supporting nodeJs v12 anymore"
> ```
--------------------
## Reason 
> This change was made because:
> Discord.js master branch (v13) will be using nodeJs v14 
>
> Better Error Handling Because of the new Syntax that nodeJs v14 provides
